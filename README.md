# CS-340 Grazioso Salvare 

This project aims to create a dashboard for the client Grazioso Salvare and uses MongoDB and Python as an application that delivers information to the client when searching for potential rescue animals to train.

## Description
This application used MongoDB as the database and Python to create a web-based interactive dashboard for the client in which they can access a provided database. This provided database is based on an animal shelter which is used to find desired animals that are training candidates based on the requirements that the client would like to see such as age, species, and gender. 

Python is then used to create files to quickly and effectively access data from the database. In this portion of the project, we are introduced to the dash framework for the GUI of the database while also using Python to make CRUD operation for the application to behave as desired.   
 


## Features

- MonogDB
- Python 
- Pandas(python libary)
- Dash (framework)
- CRUD operation.
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project evaluation
To create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable we can use bases such as code modulation, encapsulation, and abstraction to create code that can meet all three criteria. In this project I created code that is maintainable by modulation the code and creating separate Python files to create functionally that can be used for another file that uses those functionalities, one example is the Python CRUD operation file “animalShelter.py” We use widgets in the dashboard to take in data from the database and visually display it one example of this are the widgets used. And finally, to make this project adaptable we can create a function in the code that can take a large set of queries. Another key factor is using best practices when developing code such as comments and descriptions of how the code operates and why. 

I approached a problem as a computer science student by thinking in terms of a problem solver and not just a coder. A project often needs to be seen in its entirety and in this case I studied the database and familiarized myself with how it works to the best of my abilities then I took those skills I had learned and with the help of some starter code created a working project. In the future, I plan on practicing more with MongoDB and listening to the client’s requirements when constructing a database. 
  
Computer Scientists are problem solver and more than just coders often think about how a project work not just in terms form a coding standpoint but from a Design standpoint this includes, learning and understanding Architecture, system-level thinking, and a mix of creative and critical thinking when addressing the client's needs.
